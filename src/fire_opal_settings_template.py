# The slope is multiplied by this factor. The floor function used in grouping
# rounds to the nearest integer. Since slopes in test data can have values
# such as 0.4578, 1.872, etc., rounding to whole integers isn't useful. 
# Multiply by floor_scale to get 45.78 and 187.2 - now integer rounding works!
# Effectively you are rounding to the 2nd decimal place. To round to the 3rd
# decimal place, change floor_scale to 1000.
